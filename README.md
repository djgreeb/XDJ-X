The XDJ-X is an all-in-one DJ system built on the body parts of the CDJ-1000mk3, such as the jog wheel, buttons, and pitch.

The main goal was to create a 2-channel dj setup, compact, without major compromises. Have full-fledged jog wheels, pads, a mixer layer the same as the DJM-900nxs, with an effects display imitating the vacuum display of the classic DJM.

Displays in jogs are specially selected classic VFD, not TFT. These displays have a higher response speed, requiring fewer resources. And this is their main task, when scratching.
